# Sophus

This repository takes snapshots of the upstream [sophus](https://github.com/strasdat/Sophus) repository to create release branches for ROS.

There has been times in the past when these branches accomodated minor bug fixes to make them releasable whilst active development on Sophus had paused. Recent efforts are aiming to synchronise these with the upstream repository.
